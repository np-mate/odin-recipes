            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can fat-free condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>

            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Sauté ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly; 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Drain and discard any fat from the cooked beef. Stir condensed soup and garlic powder into the beef. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Remove beef from the heat. Add egg noodles and stir to combine. Stir in sour cream and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
